There are examples of TokenStores, Authenticators and Application types. These examples provide enough to get you going, but are not a complete solution to all your needs. You will need to adapt them for your own use and situation. Private application will work out of the box, as they do not have to deal with tokens and OAuth.\r\n* The HTTP verbs are not used in the public part of the API. Create, Update and Find are used instead. This seperates the inplmentation from the the intent.\r\n* Invoices and Contacts support pagination. In the RESTful API these are off by default. For the wrapper, they are always on and default to page 1. See the Counts or Creation code examples for how to use the Page method to get all items.\r\n* Contacts support including archived contacts. Like the RESTful API, this if off by default. Use IncluceArchived(true) to include them.\r\n* Four decimal places are supported and are always on.\r\n* You will need an instance of the API per user. The user is stored as part of the API instance.\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\nThere are samples for each of the API endpoints. These have been done as console application and also a collection of NUnit tests. See the README for each of the executable and test assemblies.\r\n\r\n##Querying\r\nThere are simple filters on different endpoints.\r\n\r\n* ModifiedSince\r\n* Where\r\n* Or\r\n* And\r\n* OrderBy\r\n* OrderByDescending\r\n* Page\r\n* Offset\r\n\r\nThey are used in a [Fluent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) way, but are not LINQ. They simply create a query for the URL passed to the API. Nested queries are not handled using the syntax. Or and And need to come after a Where statement. OrderBy, OrderByDescending and Page can come anywhere.\r\n\r\n\tvar invoices = xeroApi.Invoices  \r\n\t\t.ModifiedSince(new DateTime(2014, 1, 31))  \r\n\t\t.Where(\"Total > 3500.0\")  \r\n\t\t.And(\"Total < 10000.0\")  \r\n\t\t.Page(2)  \r\n\t\t.OrderByDescending(\"DueDate\")  \r\n\t\t.Find();\r\n\r\nThe following gives the same query string to the API as the example above.\r\n\r\n\tvar invoices = xeroApi.Invoices  \r\n\t\t.Page(2)  \r\n\t\t.OrderByDescending(\"DueDate\")  \r\n\t\t.Where(\"Total > 3500.0\")   \r\n\t\t.And(\"Total < 10000.0\")  \r\n\t\t.ModifiedSince(new DateTime(2014, 1, 31))  \r\n\t\t.Find();\r\n\t\t\r\n##Application types\r\n\r\nThere are specific classes for each of the application types. If these are used, you will need to have the app.config file settings for your organisation.\r\n\r\nFor a public application you would use\r\n\t\r\n\tvar user = new ApiUser { Name = \"The users name\" };\r\n    var tokenStore = new SqliteTokenStore();\r\n\r\n    var api = new Applications.Public.Core(tokenStore, user)\r\n    {\r\n        UserAgent = \"Something to show your application\"\r\n    };\r\n\t\r\nThe config file will look like this\r\n\t\r\n    <add key=\"BaseUrl\" value=\"https://api.xero.com\"/>\r\n    <add key=\"ConsumerKey\" value=\"Your Key\"/>\r\n    <add key=\"ConsumerSecret\" value=\"Your secret\"/>\r\n    <add key=\"CallbackUrl\" value=\"Your callback\"/>\r\n\t\r\nThere are classes for Private, Public and Partner applications for the Core Xero API and Australian and American Payrolls.\r\n\r\nA private application will need to also populate\r\n\r\n\t<add key=\"SigningCertificate\" value=\"Path to .pfx file\"/>\r\n    \r\nA partner application will need to also populate\r\n\r\n\t<add key=\"SigningCertificate\" value=\"Path to .pfx file\"/>\r\n\t<add key=\"PartnerCertificate\" value=\"Path to Xero issued Entrust certificate file\"/>    \r\n\r\n##Authenticators\r\n\r\nThe application classes all use implementations of IAuthenticator. See [PrivateAuthenticator](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Net/blob/master/Xero.Api.Example.Applications/Private/PrivateAuthenticator.cs) for an example. The authenticators are used by the base infrastructure to do the heavy lifting of the Xero API authentication.\r\n\r\n###PrivateAuthenticator\r\nUses RSA-SHA1 and a public/private certificate. There are no tokens and each request has to be signed.\r\n\r\n###PublicAuthenticator\r\nUses HMAC-SHA1 and the standard 3-legged [OAuth](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) process. Tokens last for 30 minutes and cannot be renewed.\r\n\r\n###PartnerAuthenticator\r\nUses RSA-SHA1 and a Xero provider certificate and then the standard 3-legged [OAuth](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) process with an additional signing certificate. Tokens last for 30 minutes and be renewed. Token renewal is not currently handled by this provider, but will be done soon.\r\n\r\n###OAuth signing\r\nAll the signing is done by a slightly modified version of the Dust library provided by [Ben Biddington](https://github.com/ben-biddington/dust). Source is included.\r\n\r\n##Token Stores\r\nThe token store implementations are separate and optional. (It is recommended that you do have a store.)\r\n\r\nThe interface ITokenStore has three methods.\r\n\r\n\tpublic interface ITokenStore\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tIConsumer Find(string user);\r\n\t\tvoid Add(IToken token);\r\n\t\tvoid Delete(IToken token);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nYou can provide your own implementation to suit the database you are using for your product. Ensure the dates on the token are stored in UTC.\r\n\r\nThe examples are\r\n\r\n* MemoryTokenStore - Dictionary of token in RAM keyed on UserId\r\n* SqliteTokenStore - A database of tokens (file on local disk). This does not support multiple add-ons in the same database. The tokens are only for the application the database was created by.\r\n\r\n##Serialization\r\n\r\nAll communication with the [Xero API](http://deverloper.xero.com) is compressed at source. Writing to the API is done with XML. The data model classes have be attributed to give a small XML payload. All communication back from the API is JSON. These details are transparent to the user of the class library.\r\n\r\n##Acknowledgements\r\nThanks for the following Open Source libraries for making the wrapper and samples easier\r\n\r\n* [Dust](https://github.com/ben-biddington/dust) - OAuth\r\n* [Dapper](https://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/) - database access\r\n* [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) - unit tests\r\n* [ServiceStack.Text](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text/tree/v3) - serialization\r\n* [SQLite](http://http://system.data.sqlite.org/) - file based database\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nThis software is published under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2014 Xero Limited\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n\tobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\n\tfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\n\trestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\n\tcopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n\tcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n\tSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\n\tconditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n\tincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n\tEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\n\tOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n\tNONINFRINGEMENT.
